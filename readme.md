# IP address to emoji

This is a simple script that converts IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to emoji in an attempt to shorten and improve readability over standard IP addresses.

[You can test it out here.](https://6connect.github.io/ip-address-emoji/)

```html
<script src="https://6connect.github.io/ip-address-emoji/ip.js"></script>
```
```js
console.log(
    ipemotes.encode('192.168.0.1'),
    ipemotes.decode('✅🥖🎐🍛')
);
```

There is also a [browser extension](https://github.com/6connect/ip-address-emoji-extension/) to quickly get converting with.
